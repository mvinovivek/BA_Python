#This is a comment
#To create a comment, you can simply put "#" in the begining of the line.
#Comments are ignored by the interpreter
#Comments in programming are very useful as they help in understanding the logic 
#Always write useful comments in your code

variable_1 = 10   #Variable assignment, comments can be in end of line also

#In python it is not neccassary to declare the variables in the beginning of the program
#Also the variables can be reassigned to any value later 

variable_1 = "Vivek"

#You can assign mutilple variables in one line also 

var_1, var_2, var_3 = 10, "Vivek", 5j + 10

#Also you can see that, python is line by line based and you need not enter the ';' or any 
#other symbols to indicate that the line is over
