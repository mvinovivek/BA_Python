#In python to get the user input, we need to use the input funtion 

user_input = input()

#if we run the program, the interpreter will be waiting for the user to input a value
#followed by pressing "Enter" key

#It is a better practice to inform the end user that we are trying to get value from them
#So one can write,
print("Enter a Value")
user_input = input()

#input can also be used to pass a message to the user to understand what we are doing
user_input=input("Please enter a value")
