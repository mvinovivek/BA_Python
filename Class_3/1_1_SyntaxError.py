#In python syntax error occurs when we make mistakes in code which are not per the guidelines
#Syntax Error will occur when you 
# 1. forgot to add ":" when defining a control or function statement
# 2. forgot to add "(" or ")" in the code
# 3. forgot to close the string quotes

#As we can see they are mostly errors made by the developer and can be easily rectified!

print("This will throw error")
#the Above statement is missing a ")"

print("This will not throw error")

print(this will throw error)
#the above statement violates the standard approach of the print function

print("this will not throw error")

print("Name" + )
#This line will throw error, as + operant is meaningless here
